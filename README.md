# 👋Hello there, welcome to my profile!
I’m @Judy Njenga, a passionate **Computer Scientist** and **Full Stack Software Developer** dedicated to leveraging technology to drive innovation and solve real-world problems. I specialize in building practical and impactful software solutions using modern web technologies. From designing clean and intuitive UIs to building scalable APIs and deploying full-stack applications, I thrive in crafting systems that are both user-centric and technically robust.
With hands-on experience in frameworks like React, Next.js, Django, and Node.js, I’ve worked on projects ranging from productivity tools to enterprise platforms. I'm also deeply interested in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) — using data-driven approaches to build smarter, more adaptive systems. My AI work involves integrating intelligent features into web applications.
I enjoy working across the entire software development lifecycle — from ideation and planning to development, deployment, and iteration. Whether collaborating in agile teams or handling freelance contracts, I focus on clean code, problem-solving, and delivering solutions that make a measurable impact.
